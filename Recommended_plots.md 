1. Core Effectiveness Plots (Mandatory)

These plots demonstrate “does your system actually work better?”

1.1 Code Coverage vs Time

Plot: Line graph

X-axis: Time (minutes / CPU-hours)

Y-axis: Code coverage (% edges or basic blocks)

Compare:

Your AI-Hybrid Fuzzer

AFL

Driller

(Optional) BertRLFuzzer

Why reviewers want this:
Shows faster exploration and better guidance.

1.2 Bugs Found vs Time

Plot: Line graph

X-axis: Time

Y-axis: Unique crashes / vulnerabilities

Why:
Directly validates vulnerability discovery improvement.

2. Efficiency & Resource Usage Plots (Very Important)

These justify your “resource-aware” and “efficient” claims.

2.1 Bugs per CPU-Hour

Plot: Bar chart

Y-axis: Bugs found per CPU-hour

Why:
Strong academic metric showing efficiency, not just raw power.

2.2 Symbolic Execution Overhead

Plot: Bar chart or stacked bar

Y-axis:

Time spent in fuzzing

Time spent in symbolic execution

Compare:

Your system vs Driller

Why:
Proves RL makes smarter symbolic execution decisions.

3. RL Agent Validation Plots (Key Novelty Proof)

These plots justify the AI component, which examiners scrutinize heavily.

3.1 RL Reward vs Training Episodes

Plot: Line graph

X-axis: Training episodes

Y-axis: Cumulative reward

Why:
Shows the agent actually learns.

3.2 Action Distribution of RL Agent

Plot: Bar chart or stacked area plot

Actions:

Fuzz

Symbolic execution

Input generation

Why:
Demonstrates adaptive decision-making instead of fixed heuristics.

4. Priority & Semantic Scoring Validation (Your Unique Contribution)

These plots prove semantic vulnerability prioritization works.

4.1 Vulnerability Score vs Bugs Found

Plot: Scatter plot

X-axis: Semantic vulnerability score

Y-axis: Bugs discovered from that region

Why:
Shows prioritization is meaningful, not random.

4.2 Priority Queue Effectiveness

Plot: Bar or line chart

Metric:

Bugs found from top-K priority seeds vs random seeds

Why:
Direct validation of your priority-based feedback loop.


7. Statistical Rigor (Strongly Recommended)
7.1 Variance / Stability Plot

Plot: Box plot or error-bar plot

Metric: Bugs found across multiple runs

Why:
Reviewers expect repeatability and robustness.
